## Things I need to test
- Pub dir gets changed in configuration

## Naming conventions
- The project directory contains your source files, all themes, etc.
- Site direc:b
- When generating a file start the func name with write
- When allocating an objecet star the fun name with new

## Errors

### Using PREVIOUS

Normally "PREVIOUS" means an earlier call generated an error so
it should be propagated. Include as err.Error() in the second
parameter:

```
if err := App.writeSiteConfig(); err != nil {
  // Custom error message already generated
  return errCode("PREVIOUS", err.Error(), App.Site.configFile)
  return errCode("0902", App.Site.configFile, err.Error())
}
```


### Customizing

```
if err := Copy(source, target); err != nil {                                                                    
  return errCode("0111", "trying to copy "+source+" to "+target)                                                
}
```
### Including error messages from Go runtime calls

```
f, err := os.Create(filename)
if err != nil {
  return errCode("0210", err.Error(), filename)
}
```

## Application configuration data

Themes, shortcode files, and everything else not including the executable file are 
application configuration data.

### metabuzz.toml
On startup the first order of business is to find out where application configuration data is.
If there's a file named `metabuzz.toml` in the current directory, and if that file contains
a configdir entry, then that's where the application configuration data is supposed to be:

```
configdir="/Users/tom/code/m2"
```

Use absolute paths, not things expanded by the shell like `~`.

If there's no `metabuzz.toml` file then the application configuration
