When a new theme is created, run themevars to create 
all permutations. 

./themvars the-new-theme 

It generates a bunch of small 
Markdown files, plus a hub Markdown file ($OUTFILE in the themevars script) linking to all of theme 
versions under the name of the theme. Feel free to delete variations that don't make sense, for example, if the theme doesn't support sidebars.
