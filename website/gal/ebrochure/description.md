eBrochure works well for both sales pages *and* long-term text. By default it uses no header, no navbar, no sidebar, and no footer. It's all article. With big text, narrow columns, and plenty of white space, it's easy on the eyes even for extended lengths. But it has unique formatting for blockquotes, or blockquotes followed by and h3/h4 header combination. That makes it ideal for customer reviews.
