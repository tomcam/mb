# Create brochure-style documents that translate beautifully to PDF format

This is one of the simplest themes in the Metabuzz toolbox. It has no header, no navbar, no sidebar, and no footer. Just the article. It's meant to make easy reading of sales-oriented material, brochures, or even online stories.

One of eBrochure's striking features is its handling of blockquotes. They're inset far to the left of the body text and use vivid colors to get the reader's attention--perfect for ratings guides, reviews, and testimonials.

## Special features of this theme

### Blockquotes for reviews or customer quotes

The h3 and h4-level headers are about what you'd expect:

### Typical h3
Followed by...
#### Equally typical h4

But in the special case of a blockquote immediately followed by an H3, the formatting is changed to support additional information about the blockquote, typically an author:

> What happens when you follow a blockquote with an H3 immediately after?
### Customer Name

You can have additional information in an H4 immediately following that H3, like this:

> What happens when you follow a blockquote with an H3, then an H4 immediately after?
### Customer Name
#### Customer Company
