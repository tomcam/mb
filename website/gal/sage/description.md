# Sage, for Unmatched Clarity

Thanks kindly to the  [Edward Tufte people](https://github.com/edwardtufte) for 
[Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and 
[Osmo Salomaa](https://github.com/otsaloma) for
his faithful adaptaion of [tufte.css.org](https://github.com/otsaloma/markdown-css/blob/master/tufte.css.orig).

Visit the full [explanation](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) of this mesmerizingly
elegant style sheet.

## Theme features

The most notable feature of the Sage theme is that provides almost no CSS or HTML 
of its own. 

Text is small in the Tufte theme and screens are big. The Tufte CSS doesn't take
today's massive screens under consideration. This limits the 
width of the colums of text to make it easier to read.

Note that Sage omits all the chrome provided by Docset's generally more
commercial-looking themes: the header, nav bar, aside, and footer. 
Nothing but the bare document itself, with a style sheet scrupulously implemented 
to follow Tufte's careful direction. 
The result is a particularly clean, quick-to-load (even by Docset standards) HTML output.
