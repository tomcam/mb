## Specifying a theme in the front matter {#frontmatter}  

To choose a different theme, insert these lines to the very beginning of your file. In this example you'll choose the Debut theme, but it could just as well be any other theme like Pillar or Journey.

```
===
theme = "debut"
===
```

So a complete example might look like this:

```
===
theme = "debut"
===

# Debut theme test

How does the debut theme look?
```
