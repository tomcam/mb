## Get a better image than the one used for Intro gallery?
  [/gal/intro/light-sidebar-left.html]

## Themes
* Journey: profile column looks wrong
* Pillar: need a new color
* Reference: Line height too large on H1?
* Reference: needs to use the new gallery format
* Roma: needs dark theme?
* Roma: needs better sidebar design
* Roma: Header is no longer centered???
* Roma: needs to use new gallery format
* Sage: needs a right margin
* Update: needs a screenshot
* Zack: better sidebar

## Live Gallery
* Boring. Any way to focus it better and make it more intereting with pure HTML? 
* How do I present pagetypes?
* How to present the links and/or buttons to encourage people to try the many different variations?
* Should I use my new version of Wide or the one in the gallery screenshot?

## Visual manual for themes

Would like an easily reproducible visual guide to a theme, showing parts of the screenshot then showing the code required to do it. Can't make it live because things like headers are hard to control that way... I think. That means I need
* Standard format for illustrating areas of a screenshot using Photopea
* Standard format for manual

## Colors
* Replace blue in Wide because Pillar already uses it? But.. what color? 
* Light and dark theme versions
