## Error message: Error reading theme file 

Metabuzz can't find a theme TOML file specified in
the [front matter](front-matter.html).

## How you got here

An obvious cause is where the theme doesn't exist.
Perhaps you didn't spell the theme name correctly.

```
# Missing the "e"
theme="prsonality"
```

## What to do about it

Give the name of a theme that exists!

```
# Restored the "e"
theme="personality"
```
