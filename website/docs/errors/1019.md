## Error message: Only possible sidebar types are "right" and "left"

The article file specifies a [sidebar](../sidebar.md) type that doesn't exist.
It also mentions the name of the file containing the mistyped `sidebar=` value

## How you got here

The [front matter](../front-matter.html) specifies a sidebar type other
than "right" or left". Heres an example.

```
---
# Not a thing. They are only "right" or "left"
sidebar="true"
---
# Welcome!
```


## What to do about it

Specify either a "right" or "left" sidebar.

```
---
# This works! So does "left"
sidebar="right"
---
# Welcome!
```
