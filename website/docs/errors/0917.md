## Error message:  Error creating  template... unterminated quoted string 

A template function is missing the end of quoted string.

## How you got here

This happened when Metabuzz tried interpret a template function
part of it is missing the second quote mark.j

Example:

```
{{"{{"}} inc "theme-and-variations.md {{"}}"}} 
```
## What to do about it

Add the missing quote mark back. 
In the example above the closing quote is missing,
so the correction would look like this:

```
{{"{{"}} inc "theme-and-variations.md" {{"}}"}} 
````
