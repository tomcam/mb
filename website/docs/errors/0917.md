# 0917 

<a id="unterminated"></a>
## Error message:  Error creating  template... unterminated quoted string (error code mbz091)

A template function is missing the end of a quoted string.

## How you got here

This happened when Metabuzz tried interpret a template function
part of it is missing the second quote mark.j

Example:

```
{{"{{"}} inc "theme-and-variations.md {{"}}"}} 
```
## What to do about it

Add the missing quote mark back. 
In the example above the closing quote is missing,
so the correction would look like this:

```
{{"{{"}} inc "theme-and-variations.md" {{"}}"}} 
```


<a id="function-not-defined"></a>
## Error message: Function not defined (error code mbz0917)

A [template function](../glossary.html#template-function) was specified that doesn't exist. 

## How you got here

This happened when Metabuzz found a  template function it doesn't know about.

Here's an example of a working template function called `ftime`. This
displays the phrase **Updated:** followed by the time at which the site was created:

*Working code*
```
Updated: {{"{{"}} ftime "3:04pm" {{"}}"}} 
```

But what happens if you misspell the name of the function to `fitime`?

*Fails with the 0917 error*
```
Updated: {{"{{"}} fitime "3:04pm" {{"}}"}} 
```

## What to do about it

Try to figure out the correct function name in the [Functions](../functions.html) reference.
