## Error reading front matter
Probably the result of a malformed key/value pair in the front matter. Real-life example: the
missing equals sign in this front matter. It read like this:

```
===
title"Debut Theme"
===
```

But there should have been an equals sign separating the key
from the value, like this:

```
===
title = "Debut Theme"
===
```

Another example is a missing double-quote mark, for example:

```
===
title = Debut Theme"
===
```

It's hard to notice, but there should be a double-quote in front of the `D` as shown:

```
===
title = "Debut Theme"
===
```
