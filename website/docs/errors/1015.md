## Error message: Theme TOML specifies a file that can't be found 

While assembling the page elements from your [theme TOML file](../theme-toml-file.html)
Metabuzz encounted a file name it couldn't find. 

## How you got here

Suppose you decide to create a new header file. You add this to your theme TOML:

```
[Header]
  HTML = ""
  File = "newheader.md"
```

Then you forget to create that file. This is the error that results.

## What to do about it

Just create a file whose location is given in the error message. 
You'll see exactly where it needs to go simply by reading the 
whole error output. For example, the error message might look like this:

```
/Users/tom/code/mb/foo/index.md Theme TOML specifies a 
file that can't be found 
/Users/tom/code/mb/.mb/themes/new-pillar/press-release/newheader.md
```

The second location it gives is where Metabuzz expects to find that file.
