# Tutorial: Creating a custom theme for Metabuzz

[Theme architecture](docs/theme-architecture.md)

Metabuzz


Metabuzz themes can do a lot. That means they can get a little
complicated. But they don't have to be. You can start a theme
from scratch with almost no work, then add features to it as you
go. This tutorial does just that. It starts with little more
than a CSS file, then progresses to a complete Metabuzz theme
with support for a new custom pagetype, media queries, light and dark versions, header, navbar, sidebar, and footer.
