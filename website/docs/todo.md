# Before first release

* This actually works well in Wide:
```
## h2 Title over image
* ![Theme example](theme-1280x1024.png)
### A little more
Just a whole lot of text to see how this works. **Who wouldn't like this kind of theme?** Easy to use, looks great.
```
* Add padding-inline-start to reset.css
```
p,ol,ul,li {margin-block-start:0;margin-block-end:0;padding-inline-start:
0;} 
```

* Review each theme in gallery
  - Mobile version
  - Light, dark, with all listed variations
