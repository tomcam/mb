# About Metabuzz

* Demo images

Metabuzz is a *static site generator*--a program
designed to make the attractive, richly formatted informational websites quick and efficient. It
uses Markdown combined with a full-featured theme
system to make sites that are easy to navigate on
desktop and mobile systems dating back several years.

Because Metabuzz is run from the command line
it is by far the fastest way to generate large
themed sites.

## Audience

The sweet spot for Metabuzz is technical writers who
need to get a lot of docmenation done fast, and who don't
want to spend hours or days learning how to use a 
static site generator.

Metabuzz is ideally suited for high-throughput publications
such as news or aggregation sites. Because it's run
from the command line, it can be automated completely.

Metabuzz is a command-line utility. You must be willing
to drop into your operating system's terminal program
to use it--however, the tutorials detail
every single command you'll need to create a site.
You don't have to know the command line. You just need
to be willing to use it.

## Reasons use Metabuzz

* Metabuzz is the first static site generator to build
complete web pages including header, navigation bar, article, footer, and sidebar.
* Once you get past the need for WYSWIG site builders,
you will find that Metabuzz lets you generate large
amounts of content in structured, beautiful form
all in the least time possible.
* Metabuzz has the best documentation of any static site
generator. It assumes you don't have much time to learn
the basics, or that you might be coming back after an
extended period away. It always explains briefly why you're
about to do something, and includes ample context so you
don't need to jump around too much to get a job done.
* Most of the themes that come with Metabuzz will work
on very old smartphones. The pages Metabuzz generates
with these themes are small, making it ideal for areas
with low or expensive bandwidth.
* The Metabuzz Theme Framework (MTF) allows you to create themes with built-in responsiveness for mobile sites, light and dark themes, code injection to let you plug in features
not contemplated by the Metabuzz creators, and extensive support for SEO (search engine optimization, which makes your pages more likely to rise to the top of search results).
* The tooling is minimal. Just one executable file and
no extra SASS step--CSS variables and some minimal code
generation are used in its place.
* But wait, there's more. A lot more. See [Features](features.html) for a complete feature set.

## Reasons Metabuzz might not be right for you
* In this first version Metabuzz has no WYSIWIG features. You build sites with a text editor such as Visual Studio, then preview them in the browser.
