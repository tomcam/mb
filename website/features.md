# Metabuzz features

Here's a nearly complete list of Metabuzz features.

## Installation and configuration
* Metabuzz is easy to install. It consists of a single executable file, plus theme directories, plugins, etc.
* Metabuzz is highly customizable. It allows you
to choose where configuration files go. It automatically
generates company, branding, contact, and authoring
information into many themes.

## Themes and pagetypes (child themes)

* Metabuzz themes have a simple, one-level
inheritance feature that gives a child theme
access to the parent theme features.

## Metabuzz Theme Framework (MTF)
* You can create new themes without
knowing HTML, easily customizing: font choices, font sizes, margins,
content width, header height, branding height,
text color, headline colors, and branding colors.
* You can even build theme components such as header,
navigation bar, sidebar, article area, and 
footer, all without knowing HTML.
Themes can be implemented entirely using Markdown instead.
Or you can mix the two approaches.
* You can spend as much or as little time on a theme
as you want. If you're using a classless CSS style
sheet, you can create a theme from scratch in under a minute. You can also create
unlimited pagetypes, light and dark themes, left
or right sidebars, and complicated data-driven templates using the [Go template language](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
* The base themes are visually appealing but work
on browser dating back a decade or so. 
* Creating
a new theme based on an existing one is as easy 
as the command `mb new theme mytheme from future`,
where the Future theme is used as the basis for
a new one named MyTheme.
* You can add fuzzy search to any Metabuzz-created site
* You can generate a table of contents for any page
with one line of configuration

## Freedom of the press

* Most of the base Metabuzz themes work in old browsers,
and Javascript is only required for the optional search
feature.
* The base Metabuz themes produce very small web pages
(images take up the most space but that's entirely up
to the content creator).
